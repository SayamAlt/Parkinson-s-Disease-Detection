# Parkinson's-Disease-Detection

<p>We have started using data science to improve healthcare and services – if we can predict a disease early, it has many advantages on the prognosis. So in this data science project idea, we will learn to detect Parkinson’s Disease with Python. This is a neurodegenerative, progressive disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement and causes tremors and stiffness. This affects dopamine-producing neurons in the brain and every year, it affects more than 1 million individuals in India.</p>
